We propose to host a family dinner, with demonstrations of procedural steps of cooking interleaved with procedural steps in programming. We have analogies for iteration, recursion and data structures.\\
There will be after dinner entertainment by the robotics club.\\
We will donate the intranet set up for the robot show to our guests from Puerto Rico, who are dealing with devastation in their home while visiting here.\\
